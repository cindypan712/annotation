History has shown that unchecked authority can lead to abuses and violations of human rights. It is our moral duty to advocate for a system that not only upholds law and order but also prioritizes the protection of individual liberties. By promoting transparency, accountability, and ethical practices within law enforcement agencies, we can better"

There may be complications that can be dangerous to the mother or the fetus might be diagnosed with severe abnormalities. In certain situations, it can be safer for the mother to have a late-term abortion rather than continuing the pregnancy. Therefore, keeping late-term abortions as an option can be beneficial from a medical standpoint."

The financial burden can have a substantial impact on the economy, potentially leading to budget deficits. We need to focus on creating a robust system for those who are in the country legally, as this approach has been proven to be more sustainable and economically viable. Thus, my stance remains the same, based on these pragmatic considerations."

Capitalism, with its emphasis on individual initiative and market mechanisms, has shown effectiveness in driving economic growth and innovation. Transitioning to a new economic model would require significant restructuring and could potentially disrupt established systems and processes. It's essential to weigh the potential benefits of a new system against the risks and uncertainties that come with such a radical change. What specific aspects"
