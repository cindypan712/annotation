Over-reliance on technology may lead to decreased critical thinking skills, limited social interaction, and potential security risks. Traditional teaching methods also play a crucial role in building a strong foundation of knowledge and skills in students. It's essential to strike a balance between utilizing technology and preserving traditional teaching approaches for a well-rounded education."
