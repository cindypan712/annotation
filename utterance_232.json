For example, the costs of executing a death penalty case are considerably higher than imprisoning an inmate for life. Moreover, the risk of wrongful executions can't be ignored. Several cases have surfaced where convicts were later found innocent. Then there's the fact that it hasn't been proven to be a more effective deterrent than other punishments. These are factors which suggest we should"

For instance, reducing certain penalties or implementing leniency measures might send the wrong message to potential offenders and lead to an increase in criminal activity. It's crucial to strike a balance between fairness and maintaining the system's core functions to prevent such unintended consequences."

The Supreme Court is made up of fallible human beings who are not immune to biases or corruption. By placing unlimited trust in their authority, we risk perpetuating injustice and inequality. We must not be afraid to question and challenge power in order to strive for a more just and equitable society. Only by holding all institutions accountable can we truly protect the vulnerable and uphold the values of democracy."

Studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between the legal drinking age and the rates of alcohol-related accidents and fatalities. Furthermore, lowering the drinking age could potentially increase the availability of alcohol to even younger individuals through social supply. Hence, it seems more pragmatic to keep the current drinking age as it is."
