The law acts as a clear boundary that helps reduce overall access to alcohol for young people. Lowering the drinking age could potentially exacerbate the existing issues related to underage drinking and lead to more negative consequences. As a society, we have a duty to protect the health and well-being of our youth."

By imposing sentences on individuals who have committed crimes, we uphold the rule of law and maintain social order. This serves as a deterrent to others who may be considering engaging in criminal activities, ultimately reducing overall crime rates in society. So, maintaining the current prison system is crucial for ensuring the safety and well-being of the general public."

I believe diversifying our focus could be beneficial."
