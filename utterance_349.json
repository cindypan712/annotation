While technology might offer certain conveniences, it does not necessarily make it a superior choice. Education is more about imparting knowledge, values, and developing character, and traditional methods have been serving this purpose effectively."

Research shows that children raised by same-sex couples or LGBTQ+ individuals experience similar levels of emotional, social, and academic well-being as children raised by heterosexual parents. By allowing LGBTQ+ individuals to become parents, we are providing loving and caring homes for children in need of families, ultimately improving their overall well-being and sense of belonging."

Marijuana can be a gateway drug for some individuals, leading to potential substance abuse issues.
