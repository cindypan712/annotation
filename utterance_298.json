It's not just about healthy debates anymore; it's about deep-rooted animosity, echo chambers, and a lack of willingness to listen to opposing views. This level of polarization is tearing us apart rather than bringing us together. We need to find a way to navigate disagreements without letting them escalate into hate and division.
