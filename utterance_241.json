It's not about the potential negative impacts, but rather the fact that video games, despite their distinctiveness, are not the only or the best form of entertainment available. There are countless other ways to spend time and develop skills which are equally, if not more, valuable and enriching."

While it is important to support individuals in making decisions that align with their values, we must also consider the broader societal implications of normalizing practices that may conflict with deeply held moral convictions. Striking a balance between individual autonomy and upholding moral principles is essential for fostering a society that values both personal freedom and ethical considerations."

However, maintaining zoos and aquariums can actually complement conservation efforts in the wild by raising awareness and funding for these critical initiatives. These facilities serve as powerful educational tools that can inspire the public to take action and support conservation projects aimed at preserving natural habitats. By engaging with visitors and highlighting the importance of protecting wildlife, zoos and aquariums can mobilize resources and advocacy for comprehensive conservation strategies that address both captive and wild"

Access to birth control remains a complex issue influenced by cultural, social, and economic factors. Merely providing access to contraceptives without addressing underlying issues such as cultural taboos, affordability, or healthcare infrastructure may not lead to the desired outcomes.
