It is about recognizing the agency and autonomy of individuals engaged in these activities and providing them with the support and protections they need. By destigmatizing sex work and ensuring legal rights for sex workers, we can work towards a more inclusive and just society where all individuals are valued and respected, regardless of their occupation."

Overemphasis on military solutions can sometimes exacerbate tensions, strain diplomatic relations, and perpetuate a cycle of conflict. By prioritizing military strength over other tools of statecraft, we may inadvertently limit our ability to address security challenges through peaceful means. It's essential to maintain a balanced approach that integrates military capabilities with diplomacy, development."

Studies have shown that countries with strict gun control laws often still have high rates of gun violence. Moreover, stricter laws could potentially lead to an increase in illegal gun trades. Instead, we should consider other approaches, such as improving mental health services and socioeconomic conditions."

The cause-and-effect relationship between committing heinous acts and facing capital punishment provides a sense of justice for the victims and their families. While rehabilitation is important, for certain crimes, the safety of society and the need for justice outweigh the potential risks. It serves as a powerful deterrent and ensures that individuals think twice before committing such atrocious acts."
