Additionally, a Pew Research Center survey showed that 65% of Americans feel state governments handle issues within their state better than the federal government (2019).

Allowing one institution to have the final say on constitutionality and legal matters can potentially lead to an imbalance of power. It might be worth exploring alternative methods of checks and balances that do not rely solely on the Supreme Court to ensure accountability and protect individual rights without compromising the democratic process."

Even art and storytelling can become excessive. We should also promote diverse interests and activities to prevent an over-reliance on video games for entertainment."

In my opinion, there are alternative methods to foster a more accepting and empathetic society without resorting to legalizing substances that may have negative consequences."

Additionally, it's been observed that heavy gaming can lead to higher electricity consumption. Hence, I argue we should not encourage the development and playing of video games."

By allowing these ideas to be openly discussed and debated, we have a better chance of understanding and countering them effectively.

Prioritizing Native American rights exclusively in the pursuit of partnership and shared prosperity may inadvertently neglect the needs and interests of other marginalized groups within society.

Banning late-term abortion could infringe upon a woman's right to make decisions about her own body and future. It's essential to trust women to make the best choices for themselves and their families, especially in complex and sensitive situations. By respecting their autonomy and agency, we can uphold fundamental values of personal freedom and bodily integrity."

By removing visible markers of economic status, uniforms help create a more inclusive environment where students are judged based on their character and actions rather than their clothing choices. This can ultimately foster a more positive school culture and reduce instances of bullying or discrimination based on attire."
