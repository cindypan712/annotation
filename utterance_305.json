Instead of focusing solely on increasing troop numbers, reallocating resources to crucial areas that directly impact readiness, such as training, maintenance, and modernization, could be a more targeted and effective approach. By prioritizing investments in areas where deficiencies have been identified, the military can enhance its overall capabilities and address specific vulnerabilities without significantly expanding"

For example, there have been cases of self-driving cars malfunctioning and causing accidents themselves. Additionally, the technology is not foolproof and may struggle in certain unpredictable situations on the road. Therefore, until these issues are fully resolved and the technology is perfected, it may be premature to fully embrace self-driving cars as a solution to reducing accidents"
