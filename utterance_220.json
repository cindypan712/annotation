While I can acknowledge the impressive advancements that self-driving cars embody, I remain attached to the traditional notions of driving and the sense of control and agency it provides. The idea of completely surrendering that control to a machine, no matter how advanced, still gives me pause. In a rapidly changing world, holding onto certain familiar traditions can provide a sense of stability and comfort."

Attempts to reduce political polarization may inadvertently stifle individual expression and limit the richness of our democracy."
