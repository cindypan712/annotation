Yes, individuals might explore their preferences and gain confidence, but at what cost? The process can also result in feelings of loneliness and confusion, as users sift through profiles and face disappointment. The fear of deception and uncertainty can outweigh the benefits, making the emotional rollercoaster hard to justify. Therefore, we should be cautious in promoting such practices"

Let's work towards a world where children can marvel at the beauty of wildlife in the wild, where animals are respected and cherished in their rightful place"
