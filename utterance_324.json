It doesn't bring back the lost loved ones or heal the pain of the victims' families. Instead, it creates more suffering and doesn't address the root causes of crime. Every person, no matter their actions, has inherent dignity and should have the opportunity for rehabilitation and redemption. By abolishing capital punishment, we can move towards a more humane and just society."

Lowering the drinking age could help remove the taboo around alcohol and promote a healthier attitude towards it. It's heartbreaking to see young adults engaging in dangerous binge drinking because they feel the need to rebel or prove something. Let's give them the opportunity to learn how to."

Expanding executive powers can provide the agility needed to respond promptly to pressing issues without getting bogged down in lengthy debates or bureaucratic processes. By empowering the executive branch, we can ensure that critical decisions are made in a timely manner, addressing urgent needs and challenges effectively. This can lead to more efficient governance and better outcomes for the country."

For instance, the poverty rate among Native Americans is 25.4%, significantly higher than the national average of 10.5%. Furthermore, only 19.5% of Native Americans hold a Bachelor's degree or higher, compared to 36% of the overall population. This data clearly indicates systemic disadvantages that need to be addressed by strengthening Native American"

Just like how smartphones changed the way we communicate, self-driving cars could change the way we travel. Instead of viewing it as a loss of human control, we can see it as an evolution towards a more technologically advanced society. What are your thoughts on viewing self-driving cars from this angle?"

The history of intelligence agencies has shown instances where initially well-intentioned measures have gradually eroded privacy rights. Even with oversight mechanisms in place, there is a persistent concern about the potential for abuse of power, especially in the absence of robust checks and balances. Therefore, it is crucial to approach the issue of"

This is not about the competency of its members, but about the distribution of power in our judiciary. The Supreme Court's authority shouldn't be perceived as a given simply due to its historical significance. The concentration of such power in a single entity is a concern that merits discussion."
