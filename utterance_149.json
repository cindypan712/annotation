Allowing young adults access to alcohol at an earlier age could lead to increased alcohol-related accidents, injuries, and even fatalities. The current age limit helps to minimize these risks by restricting access to alcohol during a stage of life that is already marked by significant transitions and changes. It's crucial to prioritize public health and safety when considering such policy changes"
