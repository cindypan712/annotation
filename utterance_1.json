By allowing individuals to remain in the country without proper documentation, we risk incentivizing further illegal immigration and undermining the efforts of those who are following the legal process. Deportation serves as a deterrent and emphasizes the importance of respecting the law, which is essential for a fair and orderly immigration system."

Without consequences for violating immigration laws, there is little incentive for individuals to seek legal pathways for entry and residency. By enforcing deportation policies for non-criminal undocumented immigrants, we are sending a clear message that adherence to the law is essential while also working towards comprehensive reform to address the broader issues at hand."

Excessive use of social media has been linked to issues such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. The constant exposure to curated and often unrealistic portrayals of others' lives can lead to feelings of inadequacy and comparison. Additionally, the addictive nature of social media can contribute to decreased productivity and increased feelings of isolation."

Moreover, the existence of cyberbullying and online harassment, despite being in 'supportive communities', amplifies its potential harm."
