It's true that we must protect young individuals, but exposing them to alcohol earlier could potentially harm their physical, mental, and emotional development. Instead of lowering the drinking age, we should focus on improving alcohol education and promoting responsible drinking behavior within the current legal framework."

It's a profession that already exists but is underground, so bringing it into the legal sphere can lead to increased taxation revenue. Besides, decriminalization can also reduce law enforcement costs related to policing sex work. What's your take on this economic perspective?"

Young adults often lack the maturity and judgment needed to handle alcohol responsibly. Lowering the drinking age could lead to an increase in alcohol-related accidents, injuries, and even fatalities among this vulnerable group. As a society, we have a duty to prioritize the safety and health of our youth over potential benefits that may come from early exposure to alcohol. It's essential to uphold regulations that aim to"

However, it's important to consider that not everyone has the same level of self-discipline or awareness when it comes to navigating the digital landscape. By limiting the influence of digital media on a broader societal level, such as through regulations on screen time for children or promoting digital well-being initiatives, we can create a more supportive environment for individuals to maintain a healthy balance."

For instance, in contexts where there is a significant demand for paid sex, decriminalization could inadvertently fuel the exploitation and trafficking of vulnerable individuals. Therefore, a comprehensive approach that combines decriminalization with robust social programs, education, and efforts to combat gender-based violence is essential to ensure the well-being and rights of all individuals"

By investing in more comprehensive rehabilitation initiatives within prisons, we can better equip individuals with the skills and support they need to successfully reintegrate into society. Studies have shown that access to education, vocational training, and mental health services can significantly reduce recidivism rates. Therefore, instead of abandoning the current prison system altogether, we should focus on improving and expanding these rehabilitation efforts."
