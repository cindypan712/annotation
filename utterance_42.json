However, it's important to know that parenting education programs are not about imposing one-size-fits-all rules. They are simply a platform to provide a variety of strategies and tips.

It's about more than just providing temporary aid or funding safe zones; it's about showing empathy, compassion, and solidarity with our fellow human beings. By opening our doors to refugees, we not only offer them a chance at a better life but also enrich our own communities with diversity, resilience, and strength. Let's not lose sight of our shared humanity."

This increased openness can then provide a platform for promoting critical thinking and empathy, ultimately leading to more constructive dialogue and collaborative problem-solving."
