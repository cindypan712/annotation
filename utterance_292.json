It's crucial to consider the broader geopolitical implications and the implications for user data privacy. TikTok's algorithm has been criticized for its potential to promote addictive behavior and harmful content. Users setting time limits and being mindful of their usage is important, but we must also consider the larger societal impact of platforms like TikTok."

That fear you feel when you think of a world where there are no checks and balances, where the powerful can trample upon the weak with no fear of retribution - that's the world we'd be stepping into. The Supreme Court is our shield, our protector. We must maintain its authority, not just for us, but for our children, for those who cannot"

History has shown that once power is centralized, it can be challenging to decentralize, leading to potential risks to democracy in the long term.

This is not due to any specific consequences that may result from its legalization, but rather a fundamental belief that the substances we allow in our society should be held to a certain standard. Marijuana, in my view, does not meet that standard."
