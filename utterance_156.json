Parents should have the freedom to explore different approaches and adapt to their child's unique needs without feeling pressured to conform to specific guidelines. Family dynamics, cultural backgrounds, and personal beliefs all play a significant role in how parents raise their children. By fostering a supportive environment that values diversity in parenting styles, we can encourage healthy development and strong family connections. Let's prioritize individualized support rather than imposing rigid restrictions."

By expanding the US Armed Forces, we are not only preparing to respond to threats but also sending a clear message to potential adversaries that aggression will not be tolerated. This deterrent effect can actually prevent conflicts from escalating and save lives in the long run. In a world where security threats are evolving and unpredictable, having a robust military is a moral imperative."
