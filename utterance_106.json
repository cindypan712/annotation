Research has shown that a solely punitive system may not effectively address the complex underlying factors contributing to criminal behavior. By incorporating elements of restorative justice and rehabilitation within the prison system, we can work towards a more holistic approach to addressing crime while still holding individuals accountable for their actions."

Studies have shown that even in well-maintained facilities, animals can suffer from captivity-related stress, health issues, and behavioral abnormalities.
