Instead of focusing solely on military strength, we should prioritize diplomacy, conflict resolution, and investing in social programs that address root causes of conflicts. It's essential to consider the ethical implications of military interventions and the potential human costs involved in expanding the armed forces. We must strive for a balance between security needs and moral responsibilities to create a more just and peaceful world for all."

Allowing all perspectives to be accessible promotes critical thinking and a deeper understanding of different viewpoints. By engaging with challenging or uncomfortable content, we have the opportunity to learn, question, and develop our own beliefs. Limiting access to certain books not only restricts intellectual freedom but also hinders the opportunity for meaningful dialogue and growth."
